Combine these three together and you get a power house token out of the hands of anyone, except the community as a whole.


UNRUGGABLE
Liquidity is locked in DxSale for 2 months and fair launched! This means the team cannot pull the liquidity and rug the project.

TOKEN BURNS
Cutting edge tokenomics keep a downward pressure on the circulating supply through burns, both manual and automatic. While simultaneously keeping upward pressure on the price floor so holders see gains.

SAFE AUTO-FARMING
8% of all transactions are distributed to holders in ETH. No need to claim, all distributions happen automatically every hour.

FAIR LAUNCH
90% of BabyThunder total supply was seeded as liquidity. This means no presale and no team tokens. Remaining 10% are allocated between the Dev, and the marketing wallet to receive dividends and reinvest into the project.

CONTINUOUSLY RISING PRICE
2% of every transaction is sent to the pancake swap liquidity pool, and newly created LP tokens are BURNED FOREVER creating a rising price floor. 5% of every transaction is allocated to marketing and development to reinvest into growing BabyThunder.
